  ## Where to define manual DNS entries?
    
  The `hosts` file contains manually defined DNS entries that allows computer to route network traffic.
  
  ```markdown
  127.0.0.1 this-computer-name.local
  192.168.xxx.xxx network-computer-name.local
  
  # You can specify IP v4 or v6
  # Generally following rules are implemented by system
  127.0.0.1 localhost loopback
  ::1        localhost
  ```
  
  > 127.0.0.1 is a special IP address that allows network communication to loop back to the same computer without going through external networks
  
  This file is used before the DNS look up, so it has priority rather than look up and can overwrite it,
  you have to be administrator or assimilate to edit this file and you do not need to restart your computer after changes.
  
  > Note : the hosts file only affect the computer on which the changes were made.
